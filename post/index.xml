For example, I was working on my side-project which sends a notification once the download is completed (was checking how DownloadManager works).
Back in 2016, you&amp;rsquo;d need to initialize NotificationManager and pending intent if notification contains custom action:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 private lateinit var notificationManager: NotificationManager private lateinit var pendingIntent: PendingIntent override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?</description></item><item><title>Recap of 2019: the art of speaking</title><link>https://aidaissayeva.github.io/post/recap-of-2019/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aidaissayeva.github.io/post/recap-of-2019/</guid><description>There is a saying in Russian “как лодку назовешь, так она и поплывет”[a boat sails in accordance with its name]. So January 1st I declared the 2019 to be more bold, tenacious and eager. And oh, has it been! 2019 was a roller-coaster of challenges and rewards.
A few things have shaped this year: 1. Personally, I hardly ever ask people for anything I want or need. But I can definitely ask someone to do a favor to help family, friends, and colleagues.</description></item><item><title>Good and sad examples of extension functions</title><link>https://aidaissayeva.github.io/post/good-and-sad-extensions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aidaissayeva.github.io/post/good-and-sad-extensions/</guid><description>This article is based off my talk at Droidcon SF this year.
Kotlin is well-known for null-safety and extension functions features among android developers. Extension functions provide the ability to make new functionality of an extending class without making changes to it. In addition, the new functionality can be declared outside of the extending class. They&amp;rsquo;re also very beneficial when you want to tweak an api that can&amp;rsquo;t be modified.</description></item></channel></rss>
