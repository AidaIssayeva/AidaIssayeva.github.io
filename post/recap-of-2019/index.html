          <p>There is a saying in Russian “как лодку назовешь, так она и поплывет”[a boat sails in accordance with its name], so Jan 1st I’ve declared the 2019 to be more bold, tenacious and eager. Oh, has it been though! It’s been a roller-coaster of challenges and rewards.</p>
<p>A few things have shaped this year:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Culturally [hello asians 👋] I do not ask anyone for myself, but I can ask someone to do a favor for my sisters, my parents, my colleagues, etc. My parents taught me “put your head down, work hard, and you’ll get rewarded”. Unfortunately, it’s not always enough. This year I’m proud of myself for stepping up and asking for promotion, although it’s due to the personal circumstance[sister’s tuition doesn’t come free] 😄.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another act of courage I’ve made when I submitted my first abstract for #AndroidSummit conference this year, and had zero hopes it’ll be selected, but it did. This is a big one[!]. I haven’t done public speaking for 8 years, and haven’t done it in english for… about my entire life, and me being a perfectionist made sure not to rest a day for 1,5 months until I finish with my research and prepare a good paper. Then the struggle of rehearsing a talk has begun over and over. On the day of the talk, anxiety and nervousness kicked in the full speed, but somehow I managed to pull through. 2 months later, I got an email my talk was selected for GDG #DevFest in Sydney, Australia. I was really excited, this was my first international and remote talk. And it went through very smoothly. Little later, two of my talks were selected for #DroidconSF . I’ve watched many videos about tech talks and decided to follow the tips from them. A lesson learnt: do not watch any videos like these before your actual talk, it’ll mess your head up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As I watched my talk going down the hill at #DroidconSF , I couldn’t bare my third talk, that I’ve given before, is getting worse and worse than the the first one. That should’ve not been a case. So I apologized in the middle of the talk[!]. Yes, it did fit a stereotype about females always saying sorry. Yes, in professional world, you keep going as it was planned. I’ve gotten many feedbacks that I should have not done it, but it happened. More importantly, I’ve apologized to myself, because it didn’t meet my expectations. Was it right doing so, or wrong - I still don’t know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My most important art of speaking this year was to recruit females in STEM. Yes, you might think what a big deal, everybody is hiring females nowadays to even the gender disbalance. But being honest and straightforward with a candidate, yet still convince to join a company takes a lot of work. From the bright minds of grace hopper program to the interns at the top universities in the U.S., I’m so glad to meet each of you, and hope to see you in my team next year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a special feeling I get every time when a female developer comes up and gives me a feedback and support. I don’t know how to explain it, but it relaxes me and calms down a lot. It is unique 💚. Please remember, regardless of the gender I will always appreciate any feedback.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For this year I had only two goals: to speak at one conference and to write one article. I’m happy to achieve both. Years of trials and fails at new year resolutions taught me a great lesson: choosing one goal only is small, because you’ll keep moving it to tomorrow and choosing more than two makes you anxious, and doesn’t help to achieve even one of them. Two is perfect - enough time to procrastinate, relax and set yourself to reach both goals!
As the year [and decade] comes to an end, I’d like to thank #androidCommunity for welcoming and continuous support, I’m very grateful to be part of the amazing community! Let’s keep up in this temp, 2020 💪 !</p>
